Hey all, really sorry that I haven't been writing my usual weekly articles.  The good news is that the reason I haven't been doing so is that I've been getting settled in in San Francisco, California!  I have started a new job as a Solutions Engineer at [Docker Inc.](http://www.docker.com).

I'm going back to writing weekly articles, don't be surprised to see me writing a fair bit about Docker too :)

Until next time, stay sassy Internet.
